        "What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on using objects to represent real-world entities and their behaviors. Key principles of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), hiding internal details.\n",
        "2. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones, inheriting attributes and methods.\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism**: Allowing different objects to be treated as instances of the same class, enabling method overriding.\n",
        "4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features of an object.\n",

While Python does not support traditional method overloading like other languages (e.g., Java), it can achieve similar functionality by using default parameters or variable-length arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`).

It is typically used to create managed attributes without directly exposing their underlying implementation.\n",

        "Ans- Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This promotes flexibility and reusability in the code. With polymorphism, a single method or function can work with objects of multiple types, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code. It enables method overriding and interfaces that allow different behaviors depending on the object, making the system easier to extend and modify."

It can contain abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but contain no implementation. Subclasses must implement these abstract methods to provide specific functionality. Abstract classes are defined using the `abc` (Abstract Base Class) module, and the class is marked as abstract by inheriting from `ABC` and using the `@abstractmethod` decorator."
